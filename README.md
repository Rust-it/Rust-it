In recent years, I really wanted to find a job that I would like. In the spring of 2024, I finally decided to start studying programming. My journey began with the book "Simple Python" by Bill Lubanovich.

I found myself in programming, because it makes me constantly learn new things, reason, generally become smarter and work on myself.
